#What is it?
Parkit is your go to app when it comes to parking. The aim of Parkit is to ease the pain of parking by allowing homeowners to rent out their driveways for an alloted amount of time. It is also a great source to make passive income. The owner can make money by renting out their driveway while they are at work or on vacation. Instead of paying $20 flat rate you can pay half that while the homeowner makes a nice sum.

#How to use it
##Parker
In order to use the app the user must register. They will have to provide there name, profile picture, car make, model, year and license plate number. Once logged in the user types in the address of the venue they are heading to and automatically they are given the address of the nearest parking stall and rate. The user then has the option to search and select a different stall. Once the user has a stall selected the user can reserve the stall. Once the user arrives at the location the user clicks the check-in button. Once the user is done the user can click the checkout button.

##Stall Owner
Just like the parker the homeowner must register with the app in order to register a stall. They simply provide their name, address and bank routing info to recieve payment. The homeowner can set the alloted time the stall is available. The stall owner also has the option to transfer what funds they have made to their bank account.
